**Our Mission:** is to explore and share the history of the internet from its inception up through today, and into tomorrow in a way that's fun and relatable to all viewers and that  inspires people without computer science backgrounds, just like us, to purse the skills needed to engage with the web development community. We aim to achieve this by going through the short, albeit immense, history of the internet including but not limited to some the technical aspects that support the network as we know it today. Along the way we highlight and pay homage to the people and companies that pioneered and shaped today's web. Finally, we pull everything forward to explore what the internet of tomorrow might look like.  

Join us on our journey and find inspiration to become a legendary Web Developer!

## ROOT - The Invention of the Internet

Today, the Internet enables billions of people around to globe to interact, exchanec messages, conduct business, find information, and so much more in virtually real time.
The ability to manage manpower, material, and information, instantly and free from barriers has changed the global landscape and humanity as a species. So how did we get here how the heck did life exist before the internet??

The origins of the Internet can be traced back to the 1950s. Back in those days, the hottest communication device was the Telephone which required a dedicated circuit that would fail if the connection was broken. Computers, let alone the internet, were practically science fiction and the earliest ones were so big they filled up entire rooms!


## The Forerunners
Leonard Kleinrock (MIT) - Helped develop underline markdown, concentrating on queing theory (basis for packet switching), demand access, and distributed control.  
Claude Shannon (MIT) - Known as the Father of Information Theory. Published "A Mathematical Theory of Communication" in 1948. Specialized in cryptography during WWII. Made Theseus, a maze solving mouse using relays for a brain.  
Paul Baran - One of the two recognized inventors of the concept digital packet switching. Tasked with creating an Indestructable Communications Network capable of surving a nuclear attack while working for RAND.  
Lawrence Roberts (MIT) - Manager and Director for the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). Led team that developed the ARPANET using packet switching and built by Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN).  
Robert Taylor - Director of ARPA and pioneer of the internet. His work Time Sharing led to the idea of one terminal capable of communicating with all machines.  
Raymond Tomlinson - A programmer otherwise known as the father of email. He wrote the original program for email using the iconic @ sign to seperate users from the computer on the ARPANET.  
Robert Metcalfe (MIT) - Co-founder of Ethernet and known for Metcalf's law which describes the effects of telecommunications network. Compiled a list of what networks could do which at the time amounted to only 19 things such as games, formulas, and java entry.  
Sir Timothy Berners-Lee - Inventor of the World Wide Web. Working for CERN, he connected Hypertext with the largest internet node at the time. He created first website ever to describe his project. Check out this out for some feels! http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html
