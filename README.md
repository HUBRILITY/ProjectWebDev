**Our Mission:** is to explore and share the history of the internet from its inception up through today, and into tomorrow in a way that's fun and relatable to all viewers and that  inspires people without computer science backgrounds, just like us, to purse the skills needed to engage with the web development community. We aim to achieve this by going through the short, albeit immense, history of the internet including but not limited to some the technical aspects that support the network as we know it today. Along the way we highlight and pay homage to the people and companies that pioneered and shaped today's web. Finally, we pull everything forward to explore what the internet of tomorrow might look like.  

Join us on our journey and find inspiration to become a legendary Web Developer!
