**Our Mission:** is to explore and share the history of the internet from its inception up through today, and into tomorrow in a way that's fun and relatable to all viewers and that  inspires people without computer science backgrounds, just like us, to purse the skills needed to engage with the web development community. We aim to achieve this by going through the short, albeit immense, history of the internet including but not limited to some the technical aspects that support the network as we know it today. Along the way we highlight and pay homage to the people and companies that pioneered and shaped today's web. Finally, we pull everything forward to explore what the internet of tomorrow might look like.  

Join us on our journey and find inspiration to become a legendary Web Developer!

## ROOT - The Invention of the Internet

Today, the Internet enables billions of people around to globe to interact, exchanec messages, conduct business, find information, and so much more in virtually real time.
The ability to manage manpower, material, and information, instantly and free from barriers has changed the global landscape and humanity as a species. So how did we get here how the heck did life exist before the internet??

The origins of the Internet can be traced back to the 1950s. Back in those days, the hottest communication device was the Telephone which required a dedicated circuit that would fail if the connection was broken. Computers, let alone the internet, were practically science fiction and the earliest ones were so big they filled up entire rooms!
